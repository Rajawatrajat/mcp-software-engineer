# MCP Software Engineer - Architecture & WCGW Design

## Overview

This MCP server has been completely refactored following the **WCGW (What Could Go Wrong)** engineering mindset. Every component assumes failure is inevitable and builds in safety, recovery, and observability.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Assume Everything Will Fail**
- Every external call has timeouts
- Every resource allocation is tracked
- Every operation can be retried
- Every error is recoverable

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
- Input validation at multiple layers
- Security checks before operations
- Resource limits enforced
- Circuit breakers for external services

### 3. **Observability First**
- Structured logging with context
- Metrics for every operation
- Health checks and monitoring
- Auto-recovery mechanisms

## Architecture Components

### Security Layer (`/src/config/security.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevent injection attacks, validate inputs, manage secrets

**Key Features**:
- Path traversal prevention
- Command injection protection
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting per tool
- Encryption for sensitive data

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Malicious file paths → Sanitized and validated
- Command injection → Special characters stripped
- DoS attacks → Rate limiting

### Configuration Management (`/src/config/index.ts`)

**Purpose**: Centralized, validated, secure configuration

**Key Features**:
- Environment variable validation
- Type-safe configuration access
- Encrypted sensitive values
- Safe defaults for everything

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Missing config → Fail-safe defaults
- Invalid values → Validation on load
- Secret leakage → Automatic redaction in logs

### Logging System (`/src/utils/logger.ts`)

**Purpose**: Structured, contextual, performance-aware logging

**Key Features**:
- Request ID tracking
- User context preservation
- Automatic PII redaction
- Multiple output targets
- Log rotation

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Lost context → Request IDs throughout
- Disk full → Log rotation
- Performance impact → Async logging
- Security leaks → Automatic sanitization

### Error Handling (`/src/utils/errors.ts`)

**Purpose**: Consistent, recoverable error handling

**Key Features**:
- Typed error hierarchy
- Operational vs programmer errors
- Retry strategies
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Error context preservation

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Cascading failures → Circuit breakers
- Transient errors → Automatic retry
- Lost context → Error chain preservation
- Silent failures → Forced handling

### Base Tool Framework (`/src/tools/base-tool.ts`)

**Purpose**: Consistent safety layer for all tools

**Key Features**:
- Input validation (Zod schemas)
- Output validation
- Execution timeouts
- Metric collection
- Error standardization

**Tool Types**:
- `BaseTool`: Core functionality

- Resource exhaustion → Limits enforced
- Performance issues → Automatic metrics

### Monitoring System (`/src/monitoring/metrics.ts`)

**Purpose**: Real-time performance and health tracking

**Key Features**:
- Counter, gauge, histogram metrics
- Operation performance tracking
- System resource monitoring
- Threshold-based alerts
- Percentile calculations

**Metrics Collected**:
- Request latencies (p50, p90, p99)
- Error rates by operation
- Memory usage trends
- CPU utilization
- Event loop lag

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Performance degradation → Early detection
- Memory leaks → Trend analysis
- System overload → Real-time alerts

### Auto-Recovery System (`/src/monitoring/auto-recovery.ts`)

**Purpose**: Automatic detection and recovery from failures

**Key Features**:
- Memory leak detection
- Garbage collection triggers
- Resource cleanup
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic restarts

**Recovery Strategies**:
1. **Memory Pressure**:
   - Trigger GC at 70% usage
   - Aggressive cleanup at 90%
   - Restart at 95%

2. **Event Loop Blocking**:
   - Detect delays > 100ms
   - Alert on > 5s blocks
   - Recovery for > 10s blocks

3. **High Error Rates**:
   - Circuit breaker activation
   - Backpressure implementation
   - Gradual recovery

**WCGW Mitigations**:
- Memory exhaustion → Proactive GC
- Deadlocks → Timeout and recovery
- Cascade failures → Circuit breakers
- Resource leaks → Periodic cleanup
